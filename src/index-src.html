<h3>Welcome to Joe's Projects!</h3>

<p>Here you will find my various electronic design and hardware hacking
projects.  Please click on the links to your left.</p>

<h3><a href="relay.html" color="#ffffff">Single Board Relay Computer</a></h3>

<p>After thinking about building a relay-computer for a while, I started
focusing on the flip-flop design and came up with idea for a master-slave
flip-flop with a capacitor-based latch for the master side and a hold
resistor based latch for the slave side.  Of course I wanted to try it, so I
designed a 4-bit counter...</p>

<h3><a href="verifone.html" color="#ffffff">Hacking the Verifone ZON Jr XL</a></h3>

<p>Long ago I tried to start a business and wanted to accept credit card
transactions, so I leased a credit card terminal from <a
href="http://www.cardserviceinternational.com/">CardService
International</a>.&nbsp; The business went nowhere, but I leased this
machine long enough so that eventually I came to own it.&nbsp; I'm sure it
cost me at least $1500 in lease payments...</p>

<h3><a href="acoustic.html" color="#ffffff">Acoustic Delay Line Memory</a></h3>

<p>Delay line memory always fascinated me.&nbsp; It is well known that early
computers such as the <a
href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/vs-univac-mercury-memory.html#Architecture">UNIVAC-I</a>
used mercury acoustic delay line memory.&nbsp; Less well known is that the
use of digital delay line memory continued well into the semiconductor era
in the form of <a

and <a href="http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/vic14-322.html">Quartz</a>
delay line memories for calculators...</p>
