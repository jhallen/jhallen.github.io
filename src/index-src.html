<h3>Single Board Relay Computer "Trainer"</h3>

<p>The Single Board Relay Computer (or Relay Trainer) is a computer whose
CPU is made out of electromechanical relays (like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)">Konrad Zuse's Z3</a> from
1941), but with memory and front panel interface built from modern
semiconductors (like the 1970s and 80s single board "trainer" computers,
such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIM-1">KIM-1</a>).</p>

<p>Yes, there are videos!  Check out the <a href="example-code.html">example programs
page</a>.</p>

<h3>2017 Update</h3>

<p>After a long delay, a third version and run of boards has been produced. 
This new version improves the manufacturability and serviceability
of the computer.  With this new design, 8 out of 10 boards immediately
worked, and the remaining two were easily diagnosed and repaired.</p>

<ul>
<li>All relays and integrated circuits are now socketed.</li>
<li>All relay pins now have top-side test points. The relays are spread further apart to
provide space to allow easy access to the test points.</li>
<li>Relays are labeled by function as well as by reference designator.  This makes finding a particular bit easier than having to refer to the
schematic.</li>
<li>The previous design required a 12V / 5V hard drive power supply.  This one uses a single 12V supply provided through a conventional 5.5mm barrel power connector (the 5V DC-DC converter is on the board).</li>
<li>Mounting holes are now included in the PCB design for standoffs or an
eventual enclosure- perhaps a wooden box.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the new version:</p>

<p>Relays are expensive and large, so primary importance is given to
keeping the relay count low.  The basic strategy is implement just the CPU
and some basic I/O using relays, but implement the memory and front panel
user interface with semiconductors.  The CPU is designed using low cost DPDT
DIP relays. The front panel and memory are implemented using Microchip PIC
microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Architectural and circuit design tricks keep the relay count for the CPU
low.  The Relay Trainer uses edge-triggered D flip-flops implemented with
just 1.5 DPDT relays / bit.  Multi-port memory reduces the number of
required register bits.  Self-modified code (borrowed from very early
computers) keep the number of registers and logic gates needed to an
absolute minimum while still maintaining an interesting instruction set.</p>

<p>Here are some of the basic characteristics of the Relay Trainer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relay count: 83</li>
<li>Datapath width: 8 bits</li>
<li>Instruction width: 32 bits</li>
<li>Instruction type: two-address (each instruction specifies two memory locations and the result is written back to one of them)</li>
<li>Memory size: 256 32-bit words (1 KB)</li>
<li>Registers: 13 bits total including 8-bit Program Counter, 1-bit carry flag, 4-bit output register</li>
<li>Performance: one cycle per instruction, up to ~12 Hz for ~12 instructions per second</li>
<li>I/O: 4 switch closure inputs and 4 relay contact outputs brought to
screw terminals.  Programs can also read from keypad and serial console and
write to serial console.</li>
<li>Supported concepts:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Subroutines (supported with self-modified code: the return address is inserted into a jump instruction)</li>
  <li>Indexing (supported with self-modified code: the index is inserted into a memory reference instruction)</li>
  <li>Multi-precision arithmetic</li>
  <li>Multiply and Divide implemented as subroutines</li>
  <li>Complete set of conditional jumps (altough there are no Zero or Negative flags, a memory word can be tested for zero and negative)</li>
  <li>Single-instruction loops with "incjne" (increment and jump if not equal to zero) instruction</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Other basic features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keypad and LED display allows you to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Display and modify memory</li>
    <li>Halt / run and single step</li>
    <li>Vary clock speed (15 pre-programmed speeds or use knob)</li>
  </ul>
<li>Discrete LEDs</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Show current 32-bit instruction given to CPU</li>
    <li>Show two 8-bit operands fetched from memory</li>
    <li>Show current program counter value</li>
    <li>Show 8-bit data being written back to memory</li>
    <li>Show carry flag and condition logic result</li>
    <li>Show input and output port bits</li>
    <li>Show the clock</li>
  </ul>
<li>Powered by 12V through 5.5mm barrel connector.</li>
<li>512 bytes of Non-volatile memory is provided to save and restore the RAM</li>
<li>Serial port provided for 9600 serial console</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Built-in assembler, disassembler and instruction trace display</li>
    <li>Load or save programs by cutting and pasting into terminal emulator window</li>
    <li>Provides 6-pin Arduino logic-level RS-232 header for use of widely
    available USB to TTL RS-232 converter cables</li>
  </ul>
<li>The relay clock is stopped when the CPU halts: this saves the life of
  the relays.  The clock resumes if you press the step or run buttons.</li>
</ul>

<i>Note</i>: The ring is chartered for projects that include a home-built
CPU. It can emulate a commercial part, that&prime;s OK. But actually using
that
commercial CPU doesn&prime;t rate. Likewise, the project must have been
at least partially built: pure paper designs don&prime;t rate either. It can
be built using any technology
you like, from relays to FPGAs.
