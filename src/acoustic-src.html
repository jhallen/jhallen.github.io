<h3>
Delay Line Memory</h3>
&nbsp;Delay line memory always fascinated me.&nbsp; It is well known that early computers such as the <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/vs-univac-mercury-memory.html#Architecture">UNIVAC-I</a> used mercury acoustic delay line memory.&nbsp; Less well known is that the use of digital delay line memory continued well into the semiconductor era in the form of <a href="http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/calculator_memory_technologies.html">Torsional</a> and <a href="http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/vic14-322.html">Quartz</a> delay line memories for calculators.<br />
<br />
Analog delay line memory also has had many uses over the years.&nbsp; One common use was for drop-out compensators in video tape recorders.&nbsp; As each video line was read from the video tape, a copy was stored in a delay line.&nbsp; If a drop-out was detected (indicated by the loss of the FM carrier) in a particular line, the signal from the previous line from the output of the delay line was substituted in its place to improve the look of the video.&nbsp; Another common use was in MTI (Motion Target Indicator) RADAR.&nbsp; In this case the signal recorded in a delay line from a previous ping was subtracted from the signal from the current ping to eliminate non-moving "clutter" and highlight anything which was moving.<br />

I thought it would be neat to make an acoustic digital delay line memory which operated at audio frequencies and used air as the delay media so that I could hear it operating.&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that Radio Shack's <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3814337">Electronics Learning Lab</a> (with instructional guides written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Mims">Forrest Mims III</a>) provides nearly all of the components necessary to build your own acoustic delay line memory.&nbsp; I used this kit, plus a speaker, a dynamic microphone and some long wires so that the speaker can be separated from the microphone by about 20 feet.<br />
<br />
Here is the schematic:<br />

Circuit Description</h3>
The key component is the 4017 decade counter / decoder.&nbsp; This chip provides the frame timing and provides an easy way to consistently locate each bit in the delay line.&nbsp; A 4001-based RC oscillator provides the clock for the 4017 and the 4013 flip-flops.&nbsp; There are 10-bit times: two of them are in the 4013 flip-flop and the remaining 8 are in the air.&nbsp; The speed of sound is about 1100 ft / second, so 20 feet separation between microphone and speaker results in a delay of about 18 ms.&nbsp; 8 bits in 18 ms means that each bit should be about 2.25 ms, so the clock frequency should be about 444 Hz.<br />
<br />
The TL272 OP-AMP amplifies the signal from the microphone. The LM339 comparator detects the signal.&nbsp; The detection threshold can be adjusted with a potentiometer.&nbsp; When a signal is detected, a 4001-based set-reset flip-flop is set.&nbsp; A 4013 D-flip flop clocks in (or "re-times") the detected bit and also clears the set-reset flip-flop.<br />
<br />
A "bit injection" exclusive-OR gate is inserted at this point of the signal path.&nbsp; This allows bits to be injected into the memory.&nbsp; When a button is pressed, the bit at that specific time is inverted by this gate.<br />
<br />
A second exclusive-OR gate and a 4013 D flip-flop are set up as a toggle flip-flop.&nbsp; When the input is a 1, the flip-flop toggles.&nbsp; This is passed through an RC high-pass filter to the LM386 audio amplifier which is connected to the speaker.&nbsp; Whenever this flop-flop toggles a "tick" sound is emitted by the speaker.&nbsp; The polarity of the "tick" doesn't really matter since some ringing will be associated with the sound.&nbsp; It's one of the cycles of the ringing which is detected by the LM339.<br />
<br />
Here is the circuit built on the Electronics Learning Lab breadboard.&nbsp; The top knob controls the detection threshold.&nbsp; The bottom knob controls the bit-rate.&nbsp; The four blue buttons each invert a specific bit of the memory:<br />

<h4>
Calibration</h4>
To calibrate and watch the circuit operating you really need an oscilloscope.&nbsp; I use an old Tektronix 485.&nbsp; One channel is connected to bit 0 of the 4017 as the "start of frame" pulse.&nbsp; The scope is set to trigger on this pulse and the time-base is set so that a bit more than a single frame fits across the screen.&nbsp; The other channel is connected to output of the re-timing flip-flop to watch for any captured bits.<br />
<br />
To calibrate the system break the path between the 4013 re-timing flip flop and the following bit injection exclusive-OR gate.&nbsp; Connect the input to the exclusive-OR gate to ground instead.&nbsp; Now turn on the circuit, hold down the button connected to bit 0 and watch the scope.&nbsp; Adjust the threshold so that you can just see a signal from the detected "tick" sounds.&nbsp; Now adjust the frequency so that the detected bit happens at the same time as the "start of frame" pulse.&nbsp; Calibration is now done, so connect the re-timing flip-flop back up to the exclusive-OR gate.&nbsp; Now the loop is closed and the circuit will automatically regenerate each detected bit.<br />

<h3>
Video</h3>
Here is a video of the delay line memory operating.&nbsp; I set each bit in turn, and then clear them in the reverse order.&nbsp; The buttons make enough acoustic noise so that pressing them sometimes sets unrelated bits.&nbsp; For this reason it is probably better to place the microphone as far from the buttons as possible:<br />

<h3>
Other Experiments</h3>
<h4>
Counter</h4>
&nbsp;You can make a counter out of the delay line memory by adding a carry flag (with another 4013 D flip-flop).&nbsp; Invert a bit if the carry flag is set (so feed the output of the carry flag into the signal injection exclusive-OR gate).&nbsp; Set the carry flag if the current bit is a 1 and the carry flag is also a 1 (so you need an AND gate).<br />
<h4>
Modulation</h4>
The Electronics Learning Lab provides a 4046 phase locked loop chip.&nbsp; With the VCO and phase detector blocks in this chip it should be possible to use a better modulation method (perhaps FSK or PSK) and thereby get more reliable operation and higher bit density.<br />
