<h3>Welcome to Joe's Projects!</h3>

<p>Here you will find my various electronic design and hardware hacking
projects.  Please click on the links to your left or read below.</p>

<h3>The Projects</h3>

<h3><a href="capsense.html" color="#ffffff">DIY pressure mat</a></h3>

<p>You can build a simple pressure mat using an aluminum foil and paper
towel capacitor.  With this Arduino sketch it can triggle a Halloween
sequence...</p>

<h3><a href="relay.html" color="#ffffff">Single Board Relay Computer</a></h3>

<p>After thinking about building a relay-computer for a while, I started
focusing on the flip-flop design and came up with idea for a master-slave
flip-flop with a capacitor-based latch for the master side and a hold
resistor based latch for the slave side.  Of course I wanted to try it, so I
designed a 4-bit counter...</p>

<h3><a href="verifone.html" color="#ffffff">Hacking the Verifone ZON Jr XL</a></h3>

<p>Long ago I tried to start a business and wanted to accept credit card
transactions, so I leased a credit card terminal from CardService
International.&nbsp; The business went nowhere, but I leased this
machine long enough so that eventually I came to own it.&nbsp; I'm sure it
cost me at least $1500 in lease payments...</p>

<h3><a href="acoustic.html" color="#ffffff">Acoustic Delay Line Memory</a></h3>

<p>Delay line memory always fascinated me.&nbsp; It is well known that early
computers such as the UNIVAC-I
used mercury acoustic delay line memory.&nbsp; Less well known is that the
use of digital delay line memory continued well into the semiconductor era
in the form of Torsional
and Quartz delay line memories for calculators...</p>

<h3><a href="editorperformance.html" color="#ffffff">Test Editor Performance Comparison</a></h3>

<p>This started out as a check on some performance problems which were fixed
for the latest version of JOE (version 4.3), but is interesting in its own
right as a comparison between some text editors...</p>

<h3><a href="mpl.html" color="#ffffff">MPL</a></h3>

<p>MPL is a PL/I-like language for Motorola's 8-bit
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800">M6800</a> development system, the
Motorola Exorciser (running MDOS).  I assume it's Motorola's answer to PL/M for
Intel's 8080 microprocessor.  The language seems to have been created before 1976.</p>

<p>It's fun to pretend it's 1978 and try to write some programs with this
language...</p>
